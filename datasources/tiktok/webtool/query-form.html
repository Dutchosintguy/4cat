    <p class="form-intro">Note that TikTok is a predominantly video-based platform, and videos cannot currently be
        downloaded via 4CAT. As such 4CAT will be of limited use processing and analysing the data; nevertheless you can
        use this scraper to get a quick list of URLs and metadata for posts for a given username or hashtag. The dataset
        will contain links to all videos scraped.</p>
    <p class="form-intro">Posts are scraped in reverse chronological order; the most recent post for a given query will
        be scraped first. Unfortunately comments cannot be scraped at this time.</p>
