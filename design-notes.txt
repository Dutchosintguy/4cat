- Split by thread folder overload

Suggestions:
- Make queries private(?)
- Killing postprocessors
- Give datasets a name?
- Clicking anywhere on the results page entries should take you to its postprocessors
- Highlight colour in header shoudl change

Analysis page:
- Decrease query information?
- Components as tabs?
- Split 
- Group/hide components?
- Why is the result of posprocessors two columns?
- Queue buttons / Options?
---- Queue -> run
---- Option button should go below
---- Change option to arrow?
- Results should remain visible when result is expanded
- Result file download string outside results box? Next to the "Add to favourites" and "Permalink" buttons?
- Buttons on top of results box in the header as icon?
- Metadata as etiquette?
- Make distinction between ran analyses and still-to-ran analyses clearer
---- Change "Analyses" to "Avalable analyses
---- Grey out already ran analyses and make sure that people see there's results on top
---- Add a label "already ran with some parameters" for processors with multiple options

Bonus options:
